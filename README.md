## :bulb: "INSTALLATION" AND REQUIREMENTS
There is no "installation", only a small hassle:
1) Edit `invlib/invoicr.php`, change (C1) company information to your own.
2) That's all. Check out `example.php`.
3) MPDF requires GD extension to work properly.
<br><br>

2) [Sponsor this project](https://github.com/sponsors/code-boxx). Even a small one time amount helps.
